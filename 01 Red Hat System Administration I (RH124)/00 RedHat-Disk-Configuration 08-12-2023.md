# RedHatDiskConfiguration
- Red Hat Manual Disk Configuration for Installation
- When configuring disk partitions for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) installation, it's essential to consider factors such as the system's purpose, the applications it will run, and the available disk space.
- Below is a generic guideline with minimum, maximum, and preferred sizes for different partitions.
- Adjust these sizes based on your specific needs.
- Assuming you are using LVM for flexibility:

# /boot Partition:
- Minimum Size: 500 MB
- Preferred Size: 1 GB
- File System: ext4
- Mount Point: /boot

# Swap Partition:
- Minimum Size: 2 GB
- Preferred Size: 4 GB (or twice the amount of RAM)
- Maximum Size: It's usually not necessary to exceed 8 GB unless your system has a very large amount of RAM.
- File System: swap

# / (Root) Partition:
- Minimum Size: 10 GB
- Preferred Size: 20 GB or more, depending on available space and intended use.
- Maximum Size: Depending on available space and needs.
- File System: ext4
- Mount Point: /

# /home Partition:
- Minimum Size: 5 GB
- Preferred Size: As much as needed based on user data and preferences.
- Maximum Size: Depending on available space and user data.
- File System: ext4
- Mount Point: /home

# /var Partition:
- Minimum Size: 2 GB
- Preferred Size: 10 GB or more, depending on the system's log and spool requirements.
- Maximum Size: Depending on log and spool requirements.
- File System: ext4
- Mount Point: /var

# /tmp Partition:
- Minimum Size: 2 GB
- Preferred Size: Depending on your needs, but 5 GB is a reasonable starting point.
- Maximum Size: Depending on temporary file storage requirements.
- File System: ext4
- Mount Point: /tmp

# /usr Partition:
- Minimum Size: 5 GB
- Preferred Size: Depending on the applications installed.
- Maximum Size: Depending on installed software and requirements.
- File System: ext4
- Mount Point: /usr

# /opt Partition:
- Minimum Size: 2 GB
- Preferred Size: Depending on your needs.
- Maximum Size: Depending on additional software or optional packages.
- File System: ext4
- Mount Point: /opt

# Notes:
Always have a backup before making changes to disk partitions.
The sizes provided are general recommendations, and you should adjust them based on your specific requirements.
The "/home," "/var," "/tmp," "/usr," and "/opt" partitions are optional, and you may choose not to create them depending on your use case.
Refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation or consult with your system administrator for more specific guidance based on your application and system requirements.
